I need help designing a robust process and an excel vba file to download data using the LSEG excel addin. Based on my documentation below. Please ask me questions and then provide a solution to improve the process using excel, vba and data quality checks.


## Problem statement.
Currently the process to download option prices is a bit cumbersome. Every month we download latest prices for multiple options with different underlyings, and for almost all strikes and maturities available. Then excel files used to download prices, are then saved in csv, and these csv files are uploaded to a mysql database.

## Target/Solution
We hope to automate as much as possible the process of collecting prices for different stikes and maturities by automating the data collection with embedded control to ensure data is correct.

## Current Process
Currently we have an excel file to download option prices for specific underlying. 

The file is composed of the following tabs:
   - Main: contains information about the underlying such as lot size, ccy, steps to take for strike (step of 10 means we look at strike with step of 10), base ticker option from bloomberg, root RIC for LSEG. This table also contains tables to build RIC option tickers such as month code: 
                Call	Put
            1	A	M
            2	B	N
            3	C	O
            4	D	P
            5	E	Q
            6	F	R
            7	G	S
            8	H	T
            9	I	U
            10	J	V
            11	K	W
            12	L	X
            But also: 
                - Last trade date (ltd)
                - bloomberg underlying ticker
                - Steps: step to decrease/increase strike to get all of them.
                - Start date: Start date at which to get the option prices.
                - Lot size
                - Name (but not used it seems)
    - Future et co: Tab to download underlying prices, dividend yield, risk free rate to be able to compute greeks and IV.
    - Tabs P1, P2, P3, C1, C2, C3: Contains the LSEG formula to get option prices. Formulas are placed on column A with a formula each 300 rows to ensure data returned by the formula will not override the next formula. Additional columns with formulas are also there to add additional information not returned by lseg formula. See below. Also on tab P1 or C1, the first strike is used to derived the others in P1 but also P2, P3 with a step of 10.
    - Tabs 

In addition of collecting prices in P1-2-3 and C1-2-3, we use the following formulas to compute the option greeks:
   - Implied_Volatility	: =@IF(B43="","",GBlackScholesImpVolBisection(H43,F43,G43,(D43-A43)/365,E43,0,B43))
   - Delta: =@IF(B43="","",GBlackScholesNGreeks($J$37,$H43,$F43,$G43,($D43-$A43)/365,+$E43,0,+$I43))
   - Vega:	 =@IF(B43="","",GBlackScholesNGreeks($K$37,$H43,$F43,$G43,($D43-$A43)/365,+$E43,0,+$I43))
   - Gamma:	=@IF(B43="","",GBlackScholesNGreeks($L$37,$H43,$F43,$G43,($D43-$A43)/365,+$E43,0,+$I43))
   - Theta:	=@IF(B43="","",GBlackScholesNGreeks($M$37,$H43,$F43,$G43,($D43-$A43)/365,+$E43,0,+$I43))
   - Rho:=@IF(B43="","",GBlackScholesNGreeks($M$37,$H43,$F43,$G43,($D43-$A43)/365,+$E43,0,+$I43))
   - DDELTA/DSPOT:	=IF($B43="","",CGBlackScholes(U$37,$H43,$F43,$G43,($D43-$A43)/365,$E43,0,$I43,$J43))
   - DDELTA/DVOL:	=IF($B43="","",CGBlackScholes(V$37,$H43,$F43,$G43,($D43-$A43)/365,$E43,0,$I43,$J43))
   - DDELTA/DVOLDVOL:	=IF($B43="","",CGBlackScholes(W$37,$H43,$F43,$G43,($D43-$A43)/365,$E43,0,$I43,$J43))
   - DDELTA/DTIME:	=IF($B43="","",CGBlackScholes(X$37,$H43,$F43,$G43,($D43-$A43)/365,$E43,0,$I43,$J43))
   - DGAMMA/DSPOT:=IF($B43="","",CGBlackScholes(Y$37,$H43,$F43,$G43,($D43-$A43)/365,$E43,0,$I43,$J43))
   - DGAMMA/DVOL:=IF($B43="","",CGBlackScholes(Z$37,$H43,$F43,$G43,($D43-$A43)/365,$E43,0,$I43,$J43))
   - DVEGA/DVOL:	=IF($B43="","",CGBlackScholes(AA$37,$H43,$F43,$G43,($D43-$A43)/365,$E43,0,$I43,$J43))
   - DVEGA/DVOLDVOL:=IF($B43="","",CGBlackScholes(AB$37,$H43,$F43,$G43,($D43-$A43)/365,$E43,0,$I43,$J43))
   
The process is as follow:

1 - Add values about the underlying in Main tab. Usually we take previous month file which is almost correct unless the underlying expired (such as a future)

2 - In tab "Future et co", We refresh LSEG formulas to refresh the underlying data that will be used for greeks computation inputs

3 - On the P1,P2,P3,C1,C2,C3 tabs, refresh the LSEG formula. Formulas are placed on column A with a formula each 300 rows to ensure data returned by the formula will not erase the next formula. We have to be careful not to keep previous prices.

4 - On every row we have the following formulas:
    - Spot_Date, Premium: Values returned by the refreshed LSEG formula: =RHistory($H$21,".Timestamp;.Close","START:"&$C$13&" END:"&$C$14&" INTERVAL:1D")
    - Ticker: =IF(A43="","",$C$21) , as a proxy for the bloomberg ticker/internal id.
    - Maturity: =$C$4, reference the current option maturity.
    - Interest_rate: =IF(A43="","",VLOOKUP(A43,'Future et co'!$A:$E,5,FALSE))
    - Spot: =IF(A43="","",VLOOKUP(A43,'Future et co'!$A:$B,2,FALSE))
    - Strike: =IF(A43="","",$B$21), reference the strike for that option.
    - Type: P or C, for Put or Call.
    - Lot_size: =IF(A43="","",$C$15)
    - Name: =IF(A43="","",$C$16)
    - Reference	: =IF(A43="","",$C$8)
    - ccy_pair	: =IF(A43="","",$C$17) (ex: USD)
    - dividends: 0 as it is 0 for our example of future emini
    - And the greeks (same list as the one above)
    
5- Finally we copy the values from all the Put tabs or Call tabs to a csv file for database upload (done in a different process)

6- We repeat with a different starting strike, and once we've done a full range of strikes (let's say from 1500 to 7000 for S&P500, could be input of process), we switch to a different maturity.

## VBA Example of LSEG Data Refresh
Below is few examples of vba code to refresh the excel files.
```
Sub RefreshMultipleSheets()
    Dim sheetsToRefresh As Variant
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim sheetName As String
    
    ' Define the sheets to refresh in order
    sheetsToRefresh = Array("P1", "P2", "P3", "C1", "C2", "C3")
    
    ' Loop through each sheet and refresh
    For i = 0 To UBound(sheetsToRefresh)
        sheetName = sheetsToRefresh(i)
        
        ' Display status
        Application.StatusBar = "Refreshing sheet: " & sheetName & "..."
        
        ' Refresh the specific worksheet
        DoEvents
        Application.Run "WorkspaceRefreshWorksheet", True, 120000, sheetName
        DoEvents
        
        ' Optional: Add a small delay between refreshes to ensure completion
        Application.Wait Now + TimeValue("00:00:02")

        ' TODO: Add a refresh calculate on the same tab.

        ' Wait few seconds and copy to another tab the result.

    Next i
    
    ' Clear status bar
    Application.StatusBar = False
    
    MsgBox "All sheets refreshed successfully!", vbInformation
End Sub
```

```
Sub WSRefreshSelection()
    DoEvents
    Application.Run "WorkspaceRefreshSelection", True, 120000
    DoEvents
End Sub
Sub WSRefreshSheet()
    DoEvents
    Application.Run "WorkspaceRefreshWorksheet", True, 120000
    DoEvents
End Sub
Sub WSRefreshWorkbook()
    DoEvents
    Application.Run "WorkspaceRefreshWorkbook", True, 120000
    DoEvents
End Sub

Sub WSRefreshAll()
    DoEvents
    Application.Run "WorkspaceRefreshAll", True, 120000
    DoEvents
End Sub
```


## Q&A

Questions:
1. Data Volume & Frequency

How many different underlyings do you typically process each month? Many but let assume we design the process for one underlying
For each underlying, approximately how many strikes and maturities are you downloading? Depends but ideally we want all maturities and strikes available. So a lot.
Are you always downloading data for the same date range, or does this vary? Every month we do the last month of data.

2. Strike Range Logic

You mentioned going from 1500 to 7000 for S&P500 - how do you determine the strike range for different underlyings? We estimate that's what we need for Put, as the S&P trades at 6500. But for call we might take above but less below.
Is this range static or dynamic based on current spot price (e.g., Â±50% from spot)? Dynamic based on spot range
The "step of 10" - is this always 10, or does it vary by underlying? No it depends on the underlying. Something we need to input.

3. LSEG Formula Details

What's the exact RHistory formula structure you're using? (I see a partial example but would like the complete formula): =RHistory("1EW7000T25^H25",".Timestamp;.Close","START:"&45505&" END:"&45897&" INTERVAL:1D")
Are there rate limits or timeout issues with LSEG that we need to handle? No
Do you need to handle cases where LSEG returns errors or no data? Yes. It could be normal to not return data but also it could be an incorrect RIC. 

4. Greek Calculation Functions

Are GBlackScholesImpVolBisection, GBlackScholesNGreeks, and CGBlackScholes custom VBA functions or from an add-in? Custom vba
If custom, do you want me to include improved versions of these in the solution? No

5. Data Quality Requirements

What specific data quality checks do you need? For example:

Checking for missing prices? Yes, sometimes it is normal if the option is expired or no contract available for that strike. Sometimes it is an incorrect RIC. 
Validating that IV is within reasonable bounds? Yes
Ensuring strike/maturity combinations are complete? Yes if you can.
Detecting stale prices? No
A report with data collected by strike and maturities would be nice. It makes sense not to have certain strikes trading but close to ATM should be available.



6. Output Requirements

Do you need separate CSV files for each underlying, or one consolidated file? Yes separate files
What's the exact CSV format/column structure needed for the database upload? : Spot_Date	Premium	Ticker	Maturity	Interest_rate	Spot	Strike	Type	Implied_Volatility	Delta	Vega	Gamma	Theta	Rho	Lot_size	Name	Reference	ccy_pair	Dividend	DDELTA/DVOL	DDELTA/DVOLDVOL	DDELTA/DTIME	DGAMMA/DSPOT	DGAMMA/DVOL	DVEGA/DVOL	DVEGA/DVOLDVOL
Do you need any logging or reporting of the download process? No

7. Process Flow Clarification

Currently, you manually change strikes and maturities - would you like this automated in a loop? Yes
Should the process handle multiple underlyings in one run, or one underlying at a time? one underlying at a time
Do you need the ability to resume if the process fails midway? Yes

8. Database Integration

Would you be interested in direct database upload from VBA instead of the CSV intermediate step? No
What database system are you using (MySQL version)? Not useful.

9. Error Handling

What should happen if LSEG data is unavailable for certain strikes/maturities? We need to have a summary of what we were able to get.
How should the system handle weekends/holidays in the data? No need.

10. Performance Considerations

How long does the current process take per underlying? Hours if not days. Very slow.
Are there any performance bottlenecks you've identified? LSEG is very slow to return data and we do it option by option but no choice around that,

Once you provide these details, I'll design a comprehensive solution with:

Automated strike/maturity iteration
Robust error handling and data quality checks
Progress tracking and logging
Optimized LSEG data refresh strategy
Modular VBA code structure for maintainability

Ok good but do not automate too much either. We need to keep control and be able to monitor if we were able to download data.
